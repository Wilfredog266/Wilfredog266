# 👋 Hey, I’m Wilfredo  

**From Chef to Data Analyst** 🍳➡️📊 — I used to create dishes, now I craft dashboards. Blending creativity, discipline, and curiosity to turn raw data into insights.  

## ⚡ About Me  

I started my career as a chef, where I learned the discipline of precision, creativity, and working under pressure. After years in hospitality, I realized I wanted to apply that same mindset to solving problems with data.  

Now I’m finishing the last sprint of the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Bootcamp**, where I’ve built projects in SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel — turning raw numbers into dashboards and insights that help answer real business questions.  

I believe in learning by doing, and every project I share here is another step in my transition from kitchens to code, from recipes to reports.
